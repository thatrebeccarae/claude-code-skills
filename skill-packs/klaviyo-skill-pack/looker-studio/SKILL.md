| Part of whole | Stacked bar or donut | Pie with >6 slices |
| Distribution | Histogram or heatmap | Scatter (if not correlation) |
| Geographic | Geo map or heatmap | Tables for location data |
| Funnel | Custom funnel (shapes) | Bar chart |
| Table data | Table with heatmap bars | Unsorted tables |

## Workflow: Build a Dashboard

When asked to create a Looker Studio dashboard:

1. **Define Purpose** — Who views it? How often? What decisions does it inform?
2. **Identify Data Sources** — Which platforms/connectors needed? Any blending?
3. **Design KPI Framework** — Primary metrics, secondary metrics, diagnostic metrics
4. **Plan Layout** — Page structure, visual hierarchy, interactivity
5. **Create Calculated Fields** — Custom metrics, CASE groupings, regex transformations
6. **Build Visualizations** — Chart types matched to data types, consistent formatting
7. **Add Controls** — Date range, filters, drill-down parameters
8. **Style & Polish** — Theme, colors, fonts, logos, white space
9. **Test & Validate** — Cross-reference numbers with source platforms
10. **Set Up Delivery** — Scheduled emails, sharing permissions, embedding

## Calculated Field Recipes

### Period-over-Period Comparison
```
CASE
  WHEN date_field >= DATE_DIFF(TODAY(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) THEN "Current Period"
  WHEN date_field >= DATE_DIFF(TODAY(), INTERVAL 60 DAY) THEN "Previous Period"
  ELSE "Older"
END
```

### Channel Grouping (Custom)
```
CASE
  WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(source_medium, "google.*cpc|google.*paid") THEN "Google Ads"
  WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(source_medium, "facebook|fb|meta|instagram") THEN "Meta Ads"
  WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(source_medium, "bing.*cpc|microsoft") THEN "Microsoft Ads"
  WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(source_medium, "email|klaviyo|braze") THEN "Email"
  WHEN source_medium = "organic" THEN "Organic Search"
  WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(source_medium, "social") THEN "Organic Social"
  ELSE "Other"
END
```

### ROAS Calculation
```
SUM(revenue) / SUM(cost)
```

## DTC Calculated Field Library

Copy-paste formulas for common DTC metrics in Looker Studio.

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
```
SUM(total_revenue) / COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_email)
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
```
SUM(ad_spend) / COUNT_DISTINCT(CASE WHEN order_number = 1 THEN customer_email ELSE NULL END)
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio
```
(SUM(total_revenue) / COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_email)) / (SUM(ad_spend) / COUNT_DISTINCT(new_customer_email))
```

### Repeat Purchase Rate
```
COUNT_DISTINCT(CASE WHEN order_count > 1 THEN customer_email ELSE NULL END) / COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_email) * 100
```

### Flow Revenue Percentage
```
SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = "flow" THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) / SUM(revenue) * 100
```

### Engagement Tier
```
CASE
  WHEN days_since_last_open <= 30 THEN "Active (0-30d)"
  WHEN days_since_last_open <= 90 THEN "Warm (31-90d)"
  WHEN days_since_last_open <= 180 THEN "At-Risk (91-180d)"
  ELSE "Lapsed (180d+)"
END
```

### Revenue Per Recipient
```
SUM(revenue) / SUM(recipients)
```

### Discount Impact
```
SUM(discount_amount) / SUM(gross_revenue) * 100
```

## Data Source Setup

### Connecting Klaviyo Data (Free Method)

Paid connectors (Supermetrics, $30-100/mo) work but aren't necessary. The free pattern:

1. **Run the data pipeline script** to push Klaviyo data to Google Sheets:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action sync-klaviyo --sheet-id YOUR_SHEET_ID
   ```
2. **In Looker Studio**, add data source > Google Sheets > select the spreadsheet
3. **Set date field type** to Date in the data source config
4. **Schedule sync** — run the pipeline daily via cron or n8n

### Connecting Shopify Data (Free Method)
1. Push order data to Sheets:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action sync-shopify --sheet-id YOUR_SHEET_ID --days 30
   ```
2. Connect the Sheet in Looker Studio
3. Blend with Klaviyo sheet on Date dimension for attribution view

### Connecting GA4 Data (Native — Free)
1. In Looker Studio, add data source > Google Analytics > select your GA4 property
2. No intermediary needed — native connector is comprehensive and free

### Creating Pre-Formatted Sheets
```bash
# Create a sheet with correct headers for a CRM dashboard
python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action create-sheet --template crm-dashboard

# See all available templates
python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action list-templates
```

## Analysis Examples

For complete dashboard build walkthroughs and use cases, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## Scripts

The skill includes a data pipeline script for pushing data to Google Sheets:

### Sync Klaviyo Data
```bash
python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action sync-klaviyo --sheet-id SPREADSHEET_ID
```

### Sync Shopify Orders
```bash
python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action sync-shopify --sheet-id SPREADSHEET_ID --days 30
```

### Create Dashboard Sheet
```bash
python scripts/data_pipeline.py --action create-sheet --template crm-dashboard
```

## Troubleshooting

**Data not refreshing**: Google Sheets data in Looker Studio caches for ~15 minutes. Force refresh with the "Refresh data" button in Looker Studio, or set the data source cache to 1 minute in report settings.

**Calculated field errors**: Most errors come from type mismatches. Ensure date fields are typed as Date (not Text) in the data source config. Use CAST() to convert between types.

**Blending shows nulls**: Left outer join means unmatched rows from the right source show null. Ensure join keys match exactly (case-sensitive, same date format).

**Sheets row limit**: Google Sheets has a 10M cell limit. For large datasets, aggregate before writing (daily summaries instead of per-event data), or use BigQuery instead.

**Service account permission errors**: The service account email must be shared on the target Google Sheet with Editor access. Check IAM permissions if Drive API calls fail.

## Security & Privacy

- **Never hardcode** API credentials in scripts — use `.env` files
- Store service account JSON **outside** version control
- Add `.env` and credential files to `.gitignore`
- The data pipeline writes to Google Sheets you control — data stays in your Google Workspace
- Pipeline scripts are read-only against Klaviyo and Shopify APIs
- Use least-privilege API scopes (read-only keys)
